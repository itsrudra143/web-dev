# ðŸ“… Day-Wise Web Development Practice

This repository contains my daily practice work for web development.  
Each folder represents what I worked on that day â€” from basic layouts to more creative and interactive designs.  

The purpose of this repo is to:
- Stay consistent with daily coding.
- Learn by building small projects every day.
- Track progress over time.

Iâ€™m keeping it simple â€” just practicing, experimenting, and improving one step at a time. ðŸš€
